# ROOTbrowser final plots

##Complex High Energy Physics (HEP) plots in action.##

ROOTbrowser also allows you to take a look at some prepared HEP histograms.

The drop-down menu (second text box) contains a number of examples of final plots.

As before, select the file you are interested in

![](pictures/ROOTbrowser/ROOTfiles.png)

Load

Then display the histogram.  In this case, click on 'WtMass;1'

Data is displayed with black filled dots.
The various simulated samples are shown in filled colours, stacked ontop of each other.  The overall shape of the combined simulated samples is very similar to the data distribution.  There is good agreement between data and simulated data.

Take a look at the other final plots.
