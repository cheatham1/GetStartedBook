# Analyses

Histogram Analyser focuses on four physics processes; the signal HWW and three background processes WW, ttbar and Z.  Let's take a look at these processes. 

## HWW

The Higgs boson appears as a consequence of the breaking of electroweak symmetry and is responsible
for giving masses to all other massive particles. The central role played by the Higgs boson in the Standard Model 
explains why the search for this particle is a centrepiece of the LHC physics programme.

The Higgs boson can decay into 2 W bosons which subsequently decay into leptons and neutrinos.

The H→WW→ℓνℓν (ℓ=electron or muon) channel is particularly sensitive in the intermediate mass range 120 < mass Higgs < 240 GeV

The major background contributions to the search in this decay mode are top ( top-pair production and W+top-quark) WW and W+jet events. Out of these
three processes, the first two contain two isolated high-pT leptons from W boson decays, which is also the signature of the signal, while for the
W+jets background, one of the jet decay products might be
mistaken for an isolated high-pT lepton. 


## WW

Two W bosons where both decay to leptons.


## ttbar

[Top](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_quark) pair production is interesting because it is a good test of the Standard Model.

It is important for discrimination between different Monte-Carlo data simulation generators,  [QCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics) models and parton distribution functions.

In addition, top pair production is an important background in various Higgs boson analyses as well as beyond the Standard Model searches.  It is therefore crucial to understand this process in detail.

Event display: A top pair candidate event recorded by ATLAS with LHC stable beams at a collision energy of 13 TeV. The red line shows the path of a muon with transverse momentum around 140 GeV through the detector. The green line shows the path of an electron with transverse momentum around 170 GeV through the detector. The green and yellow bars indicate energy deposits in the liquid argon and scintillating-tile calorimeters, from these deposits 3 jets are identified with transverse momenta between 30 and 80 GeV. Two of the jets are identified as having originated from b-quarks. Tracks reconstructed from hits in the inner tracking detector are shown as arcs curving in the solenoidal magnetic field. 

## Z

The [W](http://home.cern/about/physics/w-boson-sunshine-and-stardust) and [Z](http://home.cern/about/physics/z-boson) bosons are together known as the weak or the intermediate vector bosons. These Standard Model elementary particles mediate the weak interaction.  

The Z boson is its own antiparticle. Thus, all of its flavour quantum numbers and charges are zero. The exchange of a Z boson between particles, called a neutral current interaction, leaves the interacting particles unaffected, except for a transfer of momentum.

The production of Z bosons at the LHC is due to

* **Drell-Yan **: qqbar → Z/γ∗ → μ+μ− (65%).  A quark of one hadron and an antiquark of another hadron annihilate, creating a virtual photon or Z boson which then decays into a pair of oppositely-charged leptons. 


* **Quark gluon scattering**: qg → qγ∗/Z → qμ+μ− (35%). A quark and a gluon interact, creating a virtual photon or Z boson which then decays into a pair of oppositely-charged leptons. 


It is important to measure well known Standard Model particles, to confirm that we understand properly the detector and software.  We are then ready to search for new physics.

Event display: Candidate event with a Z boson decaying to muon pairs, recoiling against missing transverse energy (MET). The muon candidates have transverse momenta of 50 and 126 GeV.
The invariant mass of the two muons attributed to the Z candidate is 94 GeV; the MET is measured to be 161 GeV.
