The [W](http://home.cern/about/physics/w-boson-sunshine-and-stardust) and [Z](http://home.cern/about/physics/z-boson) bosons are together known as the weak or the intermediate vector bosons. These Standard Model elementary particles mediate the weak interaction.  

It is important to measure well known Standard Model particles, to confirm that we understand properly the detector and software.  We are then ready to search for new physics.

Candidate event with a Z decay to muon pairs, recoiling against missing transverse energy (MET). The muon candidates have transverse momenta of 50 and 126 GeV.
The invariant mass of the two muons attributed to the Z candidate is 94 GeV; the MET is measured to be 161 GeV.
