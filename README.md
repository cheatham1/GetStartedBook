# Get Started 
Here we present two methods of online data visualisation.  Both are easy to use, but still very powerful.  


## Histogram Analyser

**A web based tool for fast, cut-based analysis of simulated data. Visualise the simulated data using online histograms.**

This tool will show how physicists work to differentiate between physics processes.
The signatures of physics processes can look very different in the detector.
These differences are expressed via variables such as the number of leptons in an event.
The webpage displays eight histograms of variables which will be used to isolate Higgs events.  

Use your cursor to apply selections to a particular variable.
The effect on the other variables will be shown immediately.  

The Histogram Analyser will help you understand the data and the relationship between the signal and background processes. It can simplify and speed-up the selection of cuts, before coding an analysis.


## ROOT browser

**A web based tool for the more advanced user. ROOT browser lets you inspect the datasets more thoroughly.
More variables are available for display with ROOTbrowser than Histogram Analyser.  
**

You can inspect one or more datasets.
They hold the distributions for many variables of interest.
You can display the distributions and impose selections by using the cursor.

The ROOT browser can help you understand the data, before you begin writing analysis code.

**Have a go!**

## International Masterclass

If you are not an expert in particle physics or ATLAS jargon you might want to have a look at the [International Masterclass](http://atlas.physicsmasterclasses.org/en/index.htm).
