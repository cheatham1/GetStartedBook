# Get Started
Here we present two methods of online data visualisation.  Both are easy to use, but still very powerful.  


## Histogram Analyser

**A web based tool for fast, cut-based analysis of data and Monte-Carlo simulated data. Visualise data using online histograms.**

The webpage displays nine histograms of variables that are often used in particle physics analyses.  

Use your cursor to apply selections to a particular variable, and the effect on the other variables is seen immediately.  

Histogram Analyser will help you to understand the data and the relationship between the signal and background processes. It can simplify and speed-up the selection of cuts, before coding an analysis.


## ROOT browser

**A web based tool for the more advanced user. ROOT browser lets you interrogate the datasets more thoroughly.  More variables are available for display.  
**

One or more datasets can be loaded.  Distributions of variables can be easily displayed.
Selections on the different variables can be performed using the cursor.

The ROOT browser can help you understand the data, before you begin writing analysis code.

**Have a go!**

## Take a look

Use the arrows to navigate through this book. Or use the menu displayed on the left 
to access the chapters directly.  If you cannot see the menu click on the hamburger icon (4 horizontal lines) displayed top left under the "Open/Close the book" button. 

## International Masterclass

If you are not an expert in particle physics or ATLAS jargon you might want to try your hand at the [International Masterclass](http://atlas.physicsmasterclasses.org/en/index.htm) first.
