# Get Started
Here we present two methods of online data visualisation.  Both are easy to use, but still very powerful.  

## Histogram Analyser

**A web based tool allowing fast cut-based analysis on data and Monte-Carlo simulated data.  Online visualisation!
**

The webpage displays nine histograms of variables that are often used in particle physics analyses.  

Cuts can be performed with the cursor on one variable and the behaviour of the other variables is seen immediately.  

Histogram Analyser helps to understand the data and the relationship between the signal and background processes. It can simplify and speed-up the selection of cuts, before coding an analysis.


## ROOT browser

**A web based tool allowing display and interrogation of data and Monte-Carlo simulated data. Online visualisation!
**

One or more datasets can be loaded.  Distributions of variables can be easily displayed.
Cuts can be performed with the cursor on the different variables. 

The ROOT browser can help understand the data, before starting to write analysis code.

**Have a go!**


## International Masterclass

If you are not an expert in particle physics or ATLAS jargon you might want to try your hand at the [International Masterclass](http://atlas.physicsmasterclasses.org/en/index.htm) first.
