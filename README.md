# Histogram App Analyser

**A web based tool allowing fast cut-based pre-analysis on data and Monte-Carlo simulated data.  Online visualisation!
**

The webpage displays nine histogram-like plots, variables that are often used in cut-flow analysis.  

Cuts can be performed with the cursor on one variable and the behaviour of the other variables is seen immediately.  **Have a go!**

The Histogram App Analyser can simplify and speed-up the selection of cuts, before the usual coding procedure.
