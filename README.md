# Get Started

Here we present two methods of online data visualisation.  Both are easy to use, but very powerful.  **Have a go!**


## Histogram Analyser



**A web based tool allowing fast cut-based pre-analysis on data and Monte-Carlo simulated data.  Online visualisation!
**

The webpage displays nine histogram-like plots, variables that are often used in cut-flow analysis.  

Cuts can be performed with the cursor on one variable and the behaviour of the other variables is seen immediately.  

The Histogram App Analyser can simplify and speed-up the selection of cuts, before the usual coding procedure.



## ROOT browser



**A web based tool allowing display and interogation of data and Monte-Carlo simulated data. Online visualisation!
**

One or more datasets can be loaded.  Variables can be easily displayed.
Cuts can be performed with the cursor on the different variables. 

The ROOT browser can help understand the data, before starting to write analysis code.
