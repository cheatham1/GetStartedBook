## Angular separation

The angular separation between physics objects e.g.lepton pair can be important in understanding or identifying different physics processes.
It is calculated as a function of eta and phi.

## ATLAS coordinate system

The coordinate system of ATLAS is a right-handed coordinate system with the x-axis pointing towards the centre of the LHC tunnel, and the z-axis along the tunnel. The y-axis is slightly tilted with respect to vertical due to the general tilt of the tunnel. 

## Azimuth angle (phi)

Phi is measured from the x-axis, around the beam.
The ATLAS detector design is symmetrical in phi.

## Channel

The word channel signifies a certain route a physics process has taken.
For example the $$W$$ boson may decay to either a pair of hadrons or a pair of leptons.
The signature for these $$W$$ bosons in the detector are therefore either two hadrons or two leptons.
These may be referred to the hadronic and leptonic channel of the $$W$$ boson decay, respectively.
If we want to study an object we cannot directly observe, e.g. a $$W$$ boson, we must find a channel that is easily accessible.
In general, decays to leptons are easiest to spot but are not as abundant as hadronic decays.

## Glossary

This is not intended to be an exhaustive glossary.  You will find answers to many of your questions by using a search engine.  However, here are afew ATLAS physics terms explained to start you off.

## Good Run List

Good run lists are the way to select good data samples for physics analysis. 
There are a number of ways the data may not be good e.g the LHC is not in stable-beam mode, the magnets are off, some of the sub-detectors are switched off.

## Good, bad and ugly jets

Jet cleaning criteria have been developed in order to identify fake jets which arise due to noise or to out-of-time energy depositions. Jets failing these criteria are flagged as either “bad”, likely to be fake, or “ugly”, likely to be mismeasured due to falling into less well instrumented regions.

## Jet Vertex Fraction (JVF)

The Jet Vertex Fraction can be used to select jets with a high fraction of track energy originating from the selected primary vertex.  It can be used to suppress pile-up jets. 

## Jets

Jets are the dominant final state objects of high-energy proton-proton interactions at the LHC. They are key ingredients for many physics measurements and for searches for new phenomena. Jets are observed as groups of topologically-related energy deposits in the ATLAS calorimeters, most of which are associated with tracks of charged particles as measured in the inner detector. They are reconstructed and calibrated using a combination of methods based on simulation and data-driven techniques.

## Pseudorapidity (eta)

The pseudorapidity describes the angle of a particle relative to the beam axis.  

## Monte-Carlo generators

Monte-Carlo generators are programs used for simulating data.
