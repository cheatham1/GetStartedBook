## channel

The word channel signifies a certain route a physics process has taken.
For example the $$W$$ boson may decay to either a pair of hadrons or a pair of leptons.
The signature for these $$W$$ bosons in the detector are therefore either two hadrons or two leptons.
These may be referred to the hadronic and leptonic channel of the $$W$$ boson decay, respectively.
If we want to study an object we cannot directly observe, e.g. a $$W$$ boson, we must find a channel that is easily accessible.
In general, decays to leptons are easiest to spot but are not as abundant as hadronic decays.
