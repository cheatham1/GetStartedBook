# Find the Higgs 2

Now let's try to separate the signal:

## H + 0 jet
Events which contain two leptons, high MET and no jets. 

* Njets = 0
* MET > 40 GeV
* ZWindow > 50
* SumLepPt < 80
* DeltaPhiLL < 80

The dominant background after all cuts in the
H + 0 jet channel comes from continuum WW
production, with a smaller contribution from top events.


## H + 1 jet

Events which contain two leptons, high MET and 1 b-tagged jet.

* Njet = 1
* Btag = no
* MET > 40
* SumLepPt < 30 GeV
* DeltaPhiLL < 80
* ZWindow > 15

## Have a go yourself !

Try the H + 1 jet, but perhaps separate into leptonic channels with dfferent cuts.
