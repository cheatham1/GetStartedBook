# Find the Higgs

Follow the steps of a real ATLAS analysis. 

**H->WW->4l**

We are looking for a Higgs which decays into 2 W bosons which subsequently decay into leptons. 

Use the cursor to implement the following cuts, one by one.
As you apply the cuts, you should see the distributions changing.  

## Analysis 1:

If we consider both W-boson decay leptonically, the final state is characterised by the presence of two highly energetic leptons, large MET and 2 jets from the 2 b-quarks.

Select: 
* **4 jets**

* **MET > 40GeV**

* **B-tag**

* **Only electron-muon (em) channel**




## Analysis 2:


Select: 
* **0 jets**

* **MET < 20GeV**

* **No B-tag**

* **Only electron-muon (em) channel**

* **SumLepPt < 20**
