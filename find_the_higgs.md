# Find the Higgs

Follow the steps of a real ATLAS analysis. 

**H->WW->4l**

We are looking for a Higgs which decays into 2 W bosons which subsequently decay into leptons. 

Use the cursor to implement the following cuts, one by one.
As you apply the cuts, you should see the distributions changing.  

## Analysis 1:
Select: 
* **4 jets**

* **MET > 40GeV**

* **B-tag**

* **Only electron-muon (em) channel**
