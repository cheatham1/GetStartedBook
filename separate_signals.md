# Separate Signals

Let's look at the Monte Carlo simulated data.
Using the Histogram Analyser we can look at each sample separately and understand a little more about their characteristics.  This will help us separate our signal from the background later.

**Select the sample by clicking on the bar in the Expected Number of Events histogram.**  The rest of your histograms now just display the characteristics of your chosen sample.

## H→WW

**H->WW->ℓνℓν** (ℓ = electron, muon)

Our signal is the  Higgs boson which decays into 2 W bosons which subsequently decay into leptons and neutrinos.

Let's look at the individual histograms:
* The majority of Higgs events contain 0 or 1 jet.
* The analysis considers electron and muon decays of the W bosons, so the events occur in all three channels.  
* Missing transverse momentum is due to the neutrinos in the final state.  
* Mostly non b-tagged jets.
* The Reconstructed Dilepton Mass peaks at 25-45 GeV.
* The opening angle of the leptons from Higgs decays tends to be small.

## WW

Two W bosons both decaying leptonically.

Let's look at the individual histograms:
* The majority of WW events contain 0 or 1 jet.
* The analysis considers electron and muon decays of the W bosons, so the events occur in all three channels.  
* Missing transverse momentum is due to the neutrinos in the final state.  
* Mostly non b-tagged jets.
* The opening angle of the leptons from WW decays tends to be large.

The distributions are not so different from those for HWW, hence it is a difficult background process to remove.

Displaying both samples together shows why it is difficult to separate the HWW signal from the WW background.


## top quark pair

Due to its high mass and short lifetime, the top quark provides a unique environment to study a bare quark.

Looking at the individual histograms:
* The majority of WW events contain 2 or 3 jets.
* The events occur in all three channels.  
* Missing Transverse Momentum is due to the neutrinos in the final state.  
* Mostly b-tagged jets.  
* The opening angle of the leptons from top quark production is fairly evenly distributed over the whole phi range.

Histogram Analyser shows us that demanding non b-tagged jets, only 0 or 1 jet and small angular separation of leptons will reduce the top quark contribution.
