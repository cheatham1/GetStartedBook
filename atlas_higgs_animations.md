# Histogram animation

Here, you will find out how ATLAS physicists analysed experimental data to uncover the Higgs boson.

In the animation below, you can see the accumulation of Higgs events over time in the diphoton channel.  You can see the signal emerging from the background as more and more events are collected and added to the analysis.

The number of events available increases with time (notice the date) as more and more data is collected (notice the change in scale of the y-axis).
The size of the error bars on the data points decrease as the volume of data is getting larger.

Not all recorded events contain Higgs bosons.
In fact, most events are so-called background.
This means they look like the signal process but come from different sources.

Selections are made on the data to suppress background events while keeping as many Higgs events as possible. 

In Histogram Analyser you will look at a different Higgs analysis: 
The Higgs boson decaying into 2 W bosons, which subsequently decay into leptons and neutrinos.
Using the available variables you will try to select Higgs boson events and suppress the background.
