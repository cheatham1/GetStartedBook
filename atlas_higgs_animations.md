# Histogram animation

In this chapter, you will find out how ATLAS physicists analysed experimental data to uncover the Higgs boson.

In the animation below, you can see the accumulation of Higgs events over time in the diphoton channel.  You can see the signal emerging from the background as more and more events are collected and added to the analyses.

As more and more data is collected over time (notice the date changing), the number of events analysed increases (notice the change in scale of the y-axis).  The size of the error bars on the data points decreases as the volume of data increases.

Selections are made on the data to suppress background events and thus uncover Higgs events. 

In Histogram Analyser you will look at a different Higgs analysis:
the Higgs boson decaying into 2 W bosons, which subsequently decay into leptons and neutrinos.  You will try to select the Higgs sample and suppress the background by making cuts.
