# ATLAS Higgs animations

Animations of the accumulation of Higgs events over time in the diphoton and four-lepton channels.  You can see the signal emerging from the backgroud as more and more events are collected and added to the analysis.

As data is collected (notice the date changing), the number of events analysed increases (notice the change in scale of the y-axis).  The size of the error bars on the data points decrease as the volume of data increases.

Cuts have been put in place in these Higgs analyses, to suppress background and select Higgs events. 

In Histogram Analyser you will look at another Higgs analysis.  
The signal process is the Higgs boson decaying into 2 W bosons which subsequently decay into leptons and neutrinos.  You will try to select the Higgs sample and suppress the background by making cuts.
